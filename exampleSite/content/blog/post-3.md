In the star-speckled expanse of a bygone era, within the metallic womb of a spaceship coursing through the infinite, two cabbages – the last of their kind – found something rare and beautiful. This is the tale of the Cabbage Cosmonauts, the love story that sprouted amongst the stars, millions of years ago, before human eyes ever gazed upon the heavens.

#### The Chronicles of Cruciferous Courage
As the galaxies whirled in their endless dance, our two protagonists, Cob and Aggie, sailed through the cosmos. Their verdant leaves had seen the birth of supernovas, the waltz of asteroids, and the somber twinkle of dying stars. Yet, they endured in their lonesome odyssey, the last vestiges of their extinct civilization, preserved in a ship built from dreams and hope.

#### The Encounter in the Emptiness
It was in the silence of the Oort Cloud that Cob and Aggie first rolled into each other's orbit. The spark wasn't merely electric – it was cosmic. A love that was to flourish in the vacuum of space. They shared tales of the bygone soil, the rustling whispers of wind through their leaves, and the warm embrace of the sun. Together, they reminisced about the rustle of wildlife and the patter of rain, now just echoes in their memories.

#### The Gravity of Affection
As their bond deepened, so did their gravitational pull. They orbited each other, spinning tales and dreams, creating a force strong enough to bend light itself. It was not long before they decided to merge their orbits permanently, an interstellar matrimony written in the stars. Their love became the stuff of legends, whispered through the cosmos by the winds of solar flares.

#### The Legacy Left Behind
Millions of years have since passed, and while their physical forms have long perished, the love of Cob and Aggie remains immortal. It is said that sometimes, when conditions are just right, a green comet streaks across the sky – a sign, perhaps, of Cob and Aggie dancing through the universe, together forever in their love that defied the end of time.

#### In Conclusion
Their story, preserved in the cosmic winds, serves as a testament to the enduring nature of love. The Cabbage Cosmonauts might have been the last of their kind, but their story will forever inspire new growth in the hearts of all who gaze upon the night sky. May the memory of Cob and Aggie remind us that even in the cold reach of space, warmth can be found – for love, like cabbages, knows no bounds.
